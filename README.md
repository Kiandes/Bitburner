# Bitburner

These are the scripts I wrote for the Bitburner Game. Before I started this game I couldn't write any code.

Bitburner is a programming-based incremental game that revolves around hacking and cyberpunk themes. The game can be played in a [browser](https://danielyxie.github.io/bitburner) or installed through [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1812820/Bitburner/).

## ROOT

`system.js`

In this file you will find a list of scripts. 
If there is avaliable ram on home the scripts will be run. 
Otherwise main will wait.
